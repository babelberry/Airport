Airport
=======================

## What is it?

A simple Ruby programme modelling an airport, built as a weekend challenge during Week 3 of Makers Academy. The Airport lands planes and lets them take off. Before doing so, it check that it still has enough free spots that the randomly-generated weather is sunny. The grand finale is a spec modelling 6 planes landing and leaving the Airport.


## How did I build it?

I built it by myself, using:
- Ruby
- Rspec
